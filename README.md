# Introduction

This project was made for a international summit celebrated in Peru, the host was the enterprise datamine. 
The idea was to develop a software that could work withouth connection to internet, allowing the assistants to interact
dynamically with the videos and information for the whole range of software that datamine provides to the table. 

## Project

The project was developed with react and pure css since the vertical view, sizes and the design provided didn't adjusted to any css framework.
It's not possible to upload all the files that were used in the project, if you want more details please contact me, since 
it was developed with no connection all the assets and videos are on the project, no chance to upload them to the cloud.
